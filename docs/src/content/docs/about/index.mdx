#### <Xplex /> is your personal, open source, multi-streaming server to ***simultaneously stream to as many platforms as you want to***.

## 🔥 Evolution of xplex

<Xplex /> started as a self-hostable multistreaming stack for creators who wanted control — and *still is*.

But not everyone wants to manage infrastructure. Not every streamer is a sysadmin. So now, <Xplex /> is growing into something bigger:

> **The same creator-first philosophy — now with a hosted option.**

Whether you're a DIY power user or just want to go live without the hassle, <Xplex /> gives you a choice.

---

## 🧭 Our Philosophy

<Xplex /> was born from a simple idea:

> Creators should decide *where* and *how* they go live — without being locked down by platforms, paywalls, or performance trade-offs.

We built it for ourselves. Then we shared it.

Now, we're building it for *you*, too — however you want to use it.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Meet the Team

<Xplex /> is built by a small team of [passionate developers and creators](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/graphs/contributors) who care deeply about making livestreaming more accessible, flexible, and creator-first.

For technical questions or feature requests, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/issues).

And if our mission resonates with you (and you're not afraid of rolling up your sleeps to write some code) we'd love to have you on board.

Come build with us!
