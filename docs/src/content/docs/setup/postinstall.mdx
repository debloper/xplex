Regardless of the installation mechanism you went with, once you're done with it, you should be able to verify its success by accessing the `http://<hostname-or-IP>/` URL from your browser.

If you can see the <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard&mdash;then the internal components of <Xplex /> are working correctly.

You're now all set to proceed with configuring your ingest endpoints.


## Add Ingest Endpoints

<Steps>
1. **Get ingest URLs** for the streaming services you're planning to stream to. The guide to [collect ingest endpoints](/refs/change/ingest) may come in handy.

2. **Add Ingest URLs** to the `"Add new ingest URL"` field in <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard and click `"Add Ingest"` button (or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>). Make sure the URLs are correct & properly formatted.

3. **Apply Changes** once you're done adding all the outgoing ingests, to commit it to the <Xplex /> server. This will hot-reload the new configuration in the running <Xplex /> container.
</Steps>


## Configure Streaming Software

<Steps>
1. **Set Streaming Endpoint** by opening the settings/preferences of your streaming software (e.g. OBS, XSplit etc.) and updating its streaming endpoint to the <Xplex />'s ingest URL.

   ```bash title="Example xplex Ingest URL&mdash;for host IP 256.128.64.32" /256.*32/
   rtmp://256.128.64.32:1935/live
   # you can also use a hostname instead of IP, if you have the know-how
   ```

   :::note[For Mandatory Stream Key]
   If the software has two separate fields for `server URL` & `stream key` and won't let you keep the `stream key` field blank, then put the <Xplex /> ingest endpoint in the `server URL` field & any URL-safe random string in the `stream key` field (e.g. `1234` or `asdf`).

   <Xplex /> will ignore the `stream key`, and just use the `server URL` for routing.
   :::

2. **Review Encoding Settings** to ensure it uses [optimal encoding](/refs/change/encoder) that's supported by ***ALL*** the platforms you're planning to stream to.

   :::tip[Rule of Thumb]
   For maximum compatibility, stream at 1080p@30fps with a bitrate of 5000 Kbps.
   :::


3. **Run a Test Stream** before going live, to make sure everything is working as expected.

   Different platforms have different ways to test stream without going live, so check their platform documentation (e.g. for [Twitch](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq?language=en_US#FAQ)) for specific details.

</Steps>

If you've made it this far, then congrats & welcome to <Xplex content="Team xplex" />.

All the best with your multi-streaming journey!
