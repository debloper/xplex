<Xplex /> needs to listen on ports `80` (HTTP) & `1935` (RTMP) to serve the web dashboard & accept RTMP streams. So, you should ensure that these ports are available & not being used by other services.

```bash {2} title="Check ports availability"
netstat -tuln | grep -E ':80|:1935'
```

If it returns some output similar to this:

```bash title="Output if ports are busy"
user@host:~# netstat -tuln | grep -E ':80|:1935'
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1935            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp6       0      0 :::1935                 :::*                    LISTEN
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN
```

Then that means the <Badge text="ports are in use" variant="danger" /> by some other process. You should investigate further to find out which service is using the ports & decide whether to stop/disable it. In such cases it's better to <Badge text="use a fresh host system" variant="caution" /> than punching holes in an existing setup.

But if it returns <Badge text="no output" />, then the <Badge text="ports are available" /> & not being used by other services. ðŸŽ‰
